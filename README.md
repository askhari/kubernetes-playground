# Kubernetes configuration repository for our playground

In this config you will find some configurations to:

* Configure Helm using SSL for tiller and helm client.
* Create Kubernetes namespaces accounts

There is a README.md in each directory.

Also you will find some bash scripts that may ease a bit the pain of creating certificates for Helm and configuring permisions for Kubernetes service accounts.
